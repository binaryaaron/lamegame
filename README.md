Read up on git workflows for this project - we should make heavy use of feature
branches and pull requests in development.

Here are a few resources for git workflows:

* [The feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
* [git workflows that work](http://blog.endpoint.com/2014/05/git-workflows-that-work.html)
* [more git workflow talk](http://www.joslynesser.com/blog/archives/2010/09/06/git-workflow-for-small-teams/)

I say we sort of decide on a workflow on Thursday when we start typing up
Our project outline. If you want, please feel free to edit this readme and i
can turn it into a working submission for Joel once complete.

Also, here is an intro to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
the syntax for this readme file

... also, here are a few refs for game development:

## General breakdown of responsibilities 
# Initial Game Idea: Asteroids!!

Asteroids/Space shooter, multiplayer space shooter with asteroids (breakable/physics).

Ships fight against each other.

Power-ups or alternative weapons to pick up (fly through).

Health pick ups.

* Weston Ortiz
  * General physics / game interaction
  * Helping with the server, general integration, and communication
  * Collisions / network related logic for keeping collisions correct on client side, while server does most of the collision checking (hits/pickups)

* Hans

 Graphics implementation to represent game state. This is to be run on the local machine of each player in lwgl. I will add and ipmlement models, textures, and lighting for the game. I will also focus on player controls and user input on a graphical interface.



### Aaron
A major component of this project will be integrating the various features and
subfeatures with each other in an efficient way and providing assistance on
complicated features when needed. Efficient software design and best-practice
OO design priciples can ensure that this happens, including proper abstraction,
interfaces, unit and integration tests, versioning control, code reviews,
and so on. Aaron's role in this project will be to act as the person who
manages all of the above and will be available for spot help on any features
that need more man hours, and any extra time will be spent contributing to
the game physics and AI engines.

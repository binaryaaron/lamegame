# World Implementation

It looks like for our world because it is dynamic and in 3 dimensions collision
is a little bit harder.

For octrees it might be best to use a pregenerated tree of the world split up
and then use this to check for collisions in the smaller pieces of the world.

Still having some difficulties wrapping my head around octrees for 3d boxes
going to start with basic box collision.

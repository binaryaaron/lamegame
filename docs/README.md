## Notes
Read up on git workflows for this project - we should make heavy use of feature
branches and pull requests in development.

Here are a few resources for git workflows:

* [The feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
* [git workflows that work](http://blog.endpoint.com/2014/05/git-workflows-that-work.html)
* [more git workflow talk](http://www.joslynesser.com/blog/archives/2010/09/06/git-workflow-for-small-teams/)

I say we sort of decide on a workflow on Thursday when we start typing up
Our project outline. If you want, please feel free to edit this readme and i
can turn it into a working submission for Joel once complete.

Also, here is an intro to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
the syntax for this readme file
